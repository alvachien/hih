# Home Info. Hub (Website Version)
HIH is an abbreviation, which stands for Home Information Hub. HIH targets to build the warehouse for all necessary information among all family members. Key components are:
- Finance trace. This feature allows you record (nearly) all the finance activities, and provides the reports for you to review the healthy of the family, such as the balance report, cash journal, etc;
- Learning trace. This features enable you to record the target for each family member's learning targets. Learning is a habit of self growth, no matter the ages of the family members.
- Libraries (Under design phrase). 

HIH is expected to run on a HTTP/HTTPS server, which shall be easily access by all workstations/mobile devices. 
As it name indicates, HIH shall be used inside the family network. So, ideally, it runs on a NAS or Family Server with HTTP/PHP enabling.

## Who needs HIH
If you have more than two computers, no doubtly that you will feel it's hard to synchronze the data between them. Now days, it becomes more and more critical when the mobile devices are used widely to store the pieces of information. 
It's quite ture that the cloud solution, like Apple iCloud, Microsoft OneDrive gets popular recent days for the storage purpose, but it still cannot solve the issues for the structured data - overwritting files always be the last approach.

In that case, HIH provides the opportunity to share the information among the intranet (though it's quite easy to convert it into Internet part).  And, for the family usage, the finance part the learning part coming as the first part.

- 2015.7.22, Switch from Smart-Table to UI-Grid, because the column footer feature;
- 2015.7.29, Switch for ng-i18next to Angular Translate because UI-Grid integer it;
- 2015.8.2, It's DECIDED that the switch from ngJstree to UI-Grid tree mode suspended;
